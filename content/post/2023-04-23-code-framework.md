# Four Criteria

### Things that invoke a feeling

It's something that inspires you. It's essentially important in creative work. We remember such things to revoke the feeling we had.

### Things that are specific and detailed

It sometimes is boring and mundane, but why bother capturing it? Because you know it can be useful and needed some time in the future
Example: data in spreadsheet. contact information, and so on.

### Things that's personal

It can be failures or success you had. It may doesn't make sense to others but it matters to you. It can be life lesson that you want to revisit from time to time.

### Things that surprise you

It's something you never encountered before, you never experienced, you never heard of. Because if you learned or read something and not feel surprised. It means you already knew it at some level.

## Open Questions

## Organize

## Distillation

Search and highlight are syngernized to work together to learning from information

## Express

Three stages of expressing:

### Remember

It's basically collecting ideas, like when you're googling. It's the evidence or the fact that can backup your opinions. The information that you searched supports your idea, making it not merely an opinion but a point of view.

It's something that inspires you. It's essentially important in creative work. We remember such things to revoke the feeling we had.

> I think we're hard to explicitly and precisely express this idea in our head. So we tried to store it in the form of information to invoke this feeling.
